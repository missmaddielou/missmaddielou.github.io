Thanks to the kindheartedness of the BYU Travel department and (I'm sure) some finagling on his part, my dad (and Joss) came out to visit us the first week of December. This was ostensibly so that Dad could take pictures of old books and monographs in libraries that smell of peat and ovaltine, or take pictures of old sculptures that have been placed back into the recreated facades of buildings that were bombed to the ground. Joss managed to convice his high school teachers that there would be no lasting harm from missing a week near the end of the semester, so he came with, and partied with us.

To say that they hit the ground running over here would be a bit of an understatement. While Kaden was at work, I picked them up from the airport, traveled with them to the glorious air b&b they were staying in, and then they were ready to hit the town for dinner *and* make Advent wreaths *and* walk all over Hermannstraße, when lesser beings would have crawled between the sheets muttering about time zones and the hubris of humanity attempting flight. 

A bit about their location: They happened to be staying about a block away from my doctor's office.

>  TL;DR: I've spent a fair bit of time at the doctor's office, because I sprained my ankle a few weeks back. I made the mistake of carrying groceries home from our East German discount grocery -- which carries delightful relics of the last century such as pig tongue in aspic, for example, but not rice. *Emily in Paris* could never.

Kaden and I have a theroy called "The Scale of Gentrification" that we arrange Berlin neighborhoods into. The idea is that young people move to a place that is dirt-cheap, fall in love, and stay there forever, so you can tell how old the majority of tenants are by how gentrified the place is. Charlottenburg is full of distinguished octegenarians because it was the cheap part of town in the 60s and 70s. Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, where both of us work, is populated by young Gen-X or old millenials, and still has some graffiti proclaiming "Yuppie Scum get out of my Hood." Neukölln, where Dad and Joss stayed (and where a lot of our ward is) is solidly the place our generation is going to gentrify, but it isn't quite safe yet (they blew up an empty bus on New Year's Eve there, but more on that later). In spite of that, it was a charming little apartment in a charming little neighborhood, and allowed my dad to show us the less picturesque places he'd lived and worked as a missionary. 

It will be much easier for me to do a few different posts detailing everything we did, because the breakneck pace did not stop. We marched from Rudow to Pankow, from Suarezstraße to Boxhagnerstraße, wearing out our shoe leather. It was so wonderful to get to see them, to have a nice reminder that even when we feel lonely over here, there are people who love us enough to come visit us and walk all over the city with us. Ü
