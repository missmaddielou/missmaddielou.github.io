So, good news first: we got wifi! Our lovely cable arrived on Friday, and try as I might, I could not get the dang thing to work. There wasn't much time to spend on that, because we had a nice night out -- Kaden played poker with some gents from the stake, and I played cards with their wives, both of which were fantastic. So when Saturday rolled around, we dragged ourselves into the front room for one last wrestle with the modem before we would chuck it out the window and curse this whole international moving enterprise. Cowed by the threat of violence, the modem decided to give us internet. :) I was feeling a little sniffly, so, like a responsible human, I took a Covid test. It was negative, so we decided to go hit the town and grab supplies with which to celebrate our re-entry into the 21st century. 

Now, a bit about our kitchen. First off we are so dang happy to even have one -- most Germans move with their kitchens, so we would typically get a few water hook ups and some plugs. But since we are the luckiest stinkers this side of the pond, we got a full kitchen, with an oven, cabinets, a sink, and a fridge. The only downside is that the fridge is the same size as your average american dorm fridge -- the right size for a 12 pack of Mountain Dew for making it through finals (and honestly probably other cans but I went to BYU) but not really made for a week's groceries. Kaden claims this is pretty usual for German apartments, but I was always with my family, in apartments with normal fridges. 

In addition, since we don't have a car, we're limited by what I can carry -- a lot more with my little old lady trolley, but still not the 2-week stockpile I was able to bring home from Walmart in our VW Passat (oh, Berti, you were a terrible car, but you are missed.) What this means, though, is that one shopping trip is enough food for about 5 days. We had a nearly empty pantry on Saturday, but decided to go get ice cream, tea and some sparkling cider to celebrate, and pick something up for dinner. That meant that we would have enough food for dinner on Sunday, and eat our remaining cold cereal for lunch or something. Then we could go shopping on monday and all would be fine and dandy. 

On Sunday morning, though, I took another Covid test. And it was veeeery positive. 

So now I was feverish as heck, Kaden had a wicked cough, we had dwindling food supplies, and (if that wasn't enough) Europe was heading into a record breaking heatwave. We had ibuprofen and tylenol, but no cold meds. We spent the morning telling the people we had seen on friday that we were sick, then took a super long nap, then I tried to figure out which grocery stores did delivery. We found one, but their first available delivery was on Tuesday at 2 pm. Not great, but whatever. I ordered us some groceries, then we slept and coughed and sneezed and slept. We called our friends back home, watched a movie with them, and my parents bought us dinner from a nearby delivery place. It sucked that we were sick, but wasn't a bad day. 

Monday Kaden was getting a little worse and I was just gone. I slept all day, had no clue what time it was, Kaden worked a bit, and then at 7ish we peeled ourselved out of bed to scrounge for food -- leftovers from Sunday night's dinner, cold cereal, and a hunk of Gouda we had in the fridge. It was only in the high 80's on Monday, which is actually kind of great if you have a fever and are cold as heck. Mercedes flopped all over us wanting attention, and we watched a ton of TV. Kaden detangled my hair, we took like 4 baths each, and googled "how to stay cool without air conditioning" in anticipation of the next few days. 

Tuesday I was doing better and Kaden was coughing like an asthmatic smoker. It was also an average of 97 degrees. We closed off the living room and kitchen early in the morning, put a blanket on our window, filled the bathtub with cold water and put the fan in front of it. This worked out pretty dang well! We also got a text saying that our groceries had been delayed and would not be getting there until 7. Poo. So we ordered pizza from Dominos (which exists here, but in a rather different way -- we need to stop arguing about pineapple on pizza \[it's delicious\] and fight the true enemy, which is whatever sick-minded freak created tuna pizza and put CORN?! and BARBECUE SAUCE?! on it) which got us through until our groceries came. The grocery store didn't seem to carry any meds -- nary a -dryl or -quil to be found, but it did have a "curative bubble bath" which was supposed to "ease cold symptoms, and restore balance to body, mind and soul." After testing out the bubble bath, neither of us felt cured of much except of a deficit of smelling like pine.

Today, we're a little more human. I took out the trash and I'm blogging -- Kaden did some more work and is coughing the same amount, but less violently. We've lost our sense of smell and taste, making these groceries a weird experience: the only thing we can really taste well is the spicy mustard. We're still sick and a little bored, but happy to have wifi, friends and family checking in on us, and mild symptoms. We're also very happy that our bedroom is a comfortable temperature even though it's currently 100 degrees outside. Hopefully we'll get better soon, but we are so grateful for all of you who have texted, face timed, helped us get dinner delivered, and just made sure we were doing okay all sick in a foreign country!
