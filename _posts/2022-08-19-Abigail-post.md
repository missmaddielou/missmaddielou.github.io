Abigail and I probably talked about her coming to Germany with my family for the first time in the late 2000s. We had become friends after both of us came back into the school year halfway through -- I was coming back from Berlin, and she had moved in from Wisconsin. More accurately, we had been weirded out by each other, realized we had a ton in common, and then became best friends. We'd spend the summers I was gone writing huge emails to each other full of emojis and spelling errors, and talking about All The Things I'd Have To Show Her when She Came. 

I don't think we quite managed all of it, but we were close.

Now, the fun thing about being two best friends with raging, recently-diagnosed ADHD is that neither of us are very good at planning. When I picked her up from the Airport, we had absolutely no clue what the heck we would be doing for a week. But raging ADHD comes with an ability to throw together an Itinerary last minute, and have a good time doing it. The first night we went up to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag -- a wise old man (sorry dad) once told me that the best way to feel as if you are actually in a city is to go to the center of town on your first night. We took a million pictures, walked a whole bunch, and then proceded to get home very late, much to the chagrin of my very tired husband and very jet-lagged best friend. 

And then we proceeded to do way too much. We went to three different cities, two palaces, a bunch of monuments, a heap of museums, gardens, downtowns, restaurants, cafés, many trains, and so on. It was everything I had hoped, and Abigail was a very accomodating and patient guest while we learned how to tour guide!

On Saturday we packed ourselves up and the three of us went to Sansouci, the pleasure palace of King Fredrick the Great. Fredrick the Great is an interesting fellow. His father was a king of a small part of Prussia who was always starting wars and resented the fact that his son loved the arts, philosophy, and books much more than he liked starting and fighting wars. When Fredrick the Great inherited the throne and its accompanying squabbles, he ended up being a fantastic military and diplomatic ruler who united all of Prussia for the first time, and made his Prussia a major player on the world stage. Really goes to show you what delegation and studying can do for an army. This palace, though, was his pet project. 12 rooms on a gorgeous vinyard, with a library, a study, a music hall, a banquet and ballroom, and 5 guest rooms, a palace where he could write his flute concertos, host visiting dignitaries like his pen pal Voltaire, and generally enjoy the finer things in life. Right by the entrance is a statue of Ares unlacing his boots, showing that this palace is strictly for non-business related royal endeavors. The man could also design quite the castle -- golden spiderwebs and fruits, fat little angel babies arranging ivy while muses show off their various persuits. It's a diet Versailles, for the king who doesn't want that many visitors. We thought the audioguide was especially well-done, and the grounds/various other pagodas and castles were so incredible. Kaden reiterated his goal to have a room with busts of all of our friends, and added that he wants a statue of himself as Poseidon. I think that might be a little ostentatious for a two-room apartment. 

On Monday Abigail and I got to the Bahnhof bright and early to catch a train to Dresden. Dresden is one of those places you just have to go if you're up in this neck of the woods, just perfectly quaint and gothic and amazing. We explored all over the Frauenkirche, which was bombed to smithereens at the end of WWII, sat in rubble for decades during the DDR, and then was built up again in the 90s. It is also very very Baroque, with statues and paintings on top of statues and paintings. We got to explore downtown while we waited for a tour of the green vault, another king's collection of fancy dishes and oddities of all sorts. 
No pictures of that one, though -- security has tightened considerably since a break-in in 2019 where several hairpins, brooches and earrings were stolen. A bit misogynistic of the theives: if you're gonna steal, don't steal from the only case of the queen's stuff!

There was probably a lot more I should write about, but that's what I get for ignoring the blog for a month. Having Abigail with us was an absolute blast, and we miss having her around so much. It felt less like having a guest come to visit and more like having our home complete once she was there with us. We saw a whole lot and I probably walked her to death, but just having her there made everything more wonderful. Ü
