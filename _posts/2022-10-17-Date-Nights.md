This is the part where I admit that I have gotten very very backlogged and ignored this blog for far, far too long. There have been some reasons -- I got a job as a nanny, which was very nice and took up a lot of my free time, and I accepted an assignment from our church congregation to work as a seminary teacher, which means that I run a bible study group for three teenaged boys three times a week. While this is a party, it also takes up quite a bit of time; preparing an hour-long lesson geared towards teens, in your second language, feels a little bit like running through lava in flip flops. We were in a mad dash to get legal immigrant status, and Kaden has been working 40 hours a week, with an hour commute each way, so we are low on energy by the end of the day. All that to say that yes, I am writing about things that happened in September in November. Naja. (German phrase that means oh well, but describes that feeling much better. As German is wont to do.)

For my birthday, my dad got Kaden and I  tickets to a production of Brecht's Threepenny Opera at the Berliner Ensemble, the original venue where it was performed. The Threepenny Opera was written in the 20's, very vaguely based on The Beggar's Opera, and is a combination of Marxist messages about class and morality, thoroughly terrible but likeable characters, and the swingin'est showtunes Kurt Weil ever did write. It was an absolute smash hit, much to Brecht's dismay, who assumed the audience must not be understanding it. Many critics now point out, though, that a lower-class public would certainly be on board with the message of the show, and it's pretty condescending to assume otherwise. It was also very unpopular with the Nazis, a classic example of what they call "degenerate art," all the more reason to love it.  It's a weird, weird show.We hopped on the train and rode into town, right into the middle of town, and were one of the first people there, which gave us time to read over the program. The set was really interesting- there was a whole wall of platforms and ladders that actors climbed and snaked around as they were singing. The theater was absolutely packed to the brim, and we were all pretty dang excited. The production didn't at all disappoint. The songs are absolute bops, and we were cackling and shreiking through the whole performance. The actors played it sleazy, catty and unsympathetic, but so so fantastic. It was incredible to get to go to Brecht's original playhouse, and party it up there. 

Another saturday, we made our way down to the DDR museum. Here you can see typical cars, food, television shows, work stations, and a full furnished apartment from former East Germany, as it was back in the day. There was an older couple in the museum with their grandkids, and the woman kept telling her husband that "It looks just like our place! Don't you remember how we had..." It was so cool to get to see so much history, and we spent much longer than we were anticipating in the museum. It was a good time.

At one point, after Kaden was done with his work for the day, we decided to run over to Prenzlauer Berg (still the wild wild east when I was here as a kid, but now Hipster Central, DEU) and try out another one of my parents' recommendations, W imbiss. W markets themselves as the "Anti-McDonalds," and serves fusion/pescetarian food. We both ended up getting Naan pizzas, Kadens with Chimichurri and sundried tomatoes, mine with Lox and capers. It was absolutely fantastic, an awesome little restaurant where we were cheek to cheek with all the other patrons. We had a blast wandering around Prenzlauer Berg, and tried out an old photo booth. 

We also had the chance to go to a new Japanese restaurant that takes ages to get a reservation for. The family I nanny for wasn't able to go, so we took over their reservations. It was hip, with black tile and graffiti all over the outside, and we got to sit up at the bar and watch all the incredible chefs in action. It was indescribably good, and we had a great time chatting there and wondering if we were even cool enough to darken the door of this place. After that, Kaden was lured in by the siren song of the bookstore down the street, where we both ended up getting books to read on the train. 

These are kind of disjointed snapshots, but each of these moments was a time that we fell further in love with Berlin. This city is absolutely crazy, and our apartment is halfway to egypt, but every new corner of the city we explore has newm wonderful things. I have completely lost track of the times that Kaden and I have said "We need to come back to this area and go there/try this/ learn more about that!" We're slowly getting used to the idea that this is our home now. We're berliners, and we get to enjoy our city for as long as we want.
