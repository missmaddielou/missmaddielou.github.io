Today, in church, we both gave talks (nervewracking enough in English, never mind German) and there was a baby blessing, which means our pocket-sized congregation was about doubled. 
It went well, and we had a great time at church overall, but afterwards I was itching for a little adventure. We hopped on an U-bahn and two different S-bahns to go see the East Side Gallery.

## Context

The East Side Gallery is a block long section of the Berlin Wall that has been preserved and painted on by artists from all over the Globe. The murals are absolutely gorgeous, and made especially striking by the 
material their painted on. The project started in the 90s (after the wall came down in '89) and was given a slightly more offical opening in 2009, when they got little plaques by the wall. These murals are supposed 
to commemorate the wall coming down, promote international unity, or serve as a reminder of the Wall. 

## Our time there

First off, the inexorable march of time is really being a stinker. When I was here with my family, there was absolutely nothing around the east side gallery, and now there are tons of skyscrapers all around it. 
Blows my mind. Both Kaden and I were impressed by how small the wall is in person, which must have felt especially frustrating to people trying to escape into West Berlin -- it looks like a very reasonable climb, 
but with watchtowers, barbed wire, snipers, and carcinogenic materials in the padding on top (did my brother tell me that one? as an adult this feels implausible. I'll have to look this up and get back to you) it
was a tough way to try and escape. I was really impressed by a mural there called Curriculum Vitae, which had each year the wall was up painted on it, and then a little pink rose stamped on the date for every person 
who died trying to cross the wall that year. 136 Roses over the lifespan of the wall. Kaden liked one called "Es gilt viele Mauern abzubauen" or "Many a wall should be broken," which featured adults breaking a 
wall down brick by brick, and children using the bricks as blocks -- building gates this time, not walls.

It was really cool to see the gallery with a little more understanding for the history of the wall, and the stories we've heard from people in our 
communities about the DDR. Kaden says that the struggles and blessings of the German Reunification have been discussed in literally every Elder's Quorum lesson so far. Our apartment here would have been about 15 minutes walking time in to East Germany, and is nestled up next to the primary airport for dignitaries visiting East Berlin from Russia. It's 
strange to imagine the wall where it stood, 3 bus stops into Kaden's commute.

After we had spent some quality time at the East Side gallery, we wandered over to the park behind it and sat on the edge of the Spree, just downwind of some cannabis afficionados. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon, 
with people walking there dogs, big riverboats with little cafe tables floating by, and a DJ practicing his craft. A very laid back Sunday compared to some, but the perfect wind down after preparing for talks yesterday.
