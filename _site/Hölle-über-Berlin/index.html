        <p>In my experince, there is always at least one Thing That Goes Wrong while traveling. When you remember your toothbrush, you forget to pack toothpaste. When you’ve made all your flights, you miss the shuttle to
the hotel. It isn’t always catastrophic, but it is still A Thing and it Goes Wrong and you have to figure it out. These usually make the best stories but gosh, is it the worst in the moment.</p>

<p>Yesterday was an absolute banner day for Things That Went Wrong.</p>

<p>You see, Germany is a country known for its engineering prowess and efficiency. What that reputation doesn’t show is that this efficiency is actually the result of living in the least intuitive country in the world. Everything has Ze System and if you do not have all of the necessary components of Ze System for the particular task, then you are banished to France as far as I can tell. You need to have your reciept in hand after going through a self check out system so that you can scan the barcode at the gate letting you out of the store. You bring a 50c piece to put into your shopping cart so that it will unlock from the shopping cart behind it. The doors on the S-bahn flash green, when you press them, but when coming to a stop you have to wait for them to flash red, then stop flashing red, before you press it, otherwise it will start over flashing red again. I speak the language fairly well, but years of study have not at all prepared me for Ze various Systems that I would encounter each day.</p>

<p>Which brings us to yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we had two appointments at 9 am. Kaden rushed off to our town hall to do our Anmeldung, which is a meeting where you need to meet with a government official and show them that you have secured housing in their area and they are now responsible for you. Technically we should have both been at this appointment, but I dutifully filled out the “form to let someone tell the government I am here in my stead” form and sent him on his merry way. This went off with only a slight Thing That Went Wrong- he forgot our marriage lisence, so according to the german government we are two single americans shacking up. As long as the german government doesn’t tell my parents, that will be fine until tomorrow, when he can show them that we’re actually married.</p>

<p>My appointment was to wait for a technician from the internet company, who was going to figure out what our landline number was and hook up the DSL connection. The company could have just connected our apartment if they knew the apartment number- the issue is, though, that germans don’t <em>believe</em> in apartment numbers. The doorbell, the door, our mailbox- all of those have our names printed on them (formerly with a piece of masking tape, but maintenance made us official yesterday!) and don’t even get me started on how hard that makes getting amazon orders. The internet guy, who was very kind, couldn’t get the landline from our apartment, so I had to take him through the deep concrete tunnels of our basement (every aparment gets basement storage, though, which is so nice) to a box in the garage, which had the number of a different apartment building on it but was actually ours, so he could find the landline number, which it turns out was connected wrong. After this, our internet is switched on, with one small hitch: The cord that connects the wall to the modem is ganz verkaked. The repairman leaves, showing me exactly the part I need to replace.</p>

<p>Since Kaden was now at work <em>(side note: He has been killing it at his job! Right now he is making team procedures for the research division, and a few weeks ago it was his turn to share a paper in the research team’s reading group. His coworkers sure seem to adore him, seem to be super happy with how well he knows neural machine translation. He is kicking booty and I am so dang proud of him!),</em> it was up to me to trek up to the the local Media Markt (think Best Buy but with a peppermint as the logo,) and get the cord. The conversation with the salesman went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Hi, I need a TAE-RJ11 adapter cord. I haven’t seen any, do you know if you sell them?’<br />
“What are you plugging in?”<br />
“A modem”<br />
“Okay this is what you need for a router!”<br />
“I need it for a modem. Is this the smaller connection?”<br />
“Yeah it’s all standardized here. You’ll be fine.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is standardized here, but my wonderful husband, while proof-reading this post, now informs me that he bought “a Swiss and/or Austrian modem” to “save money”. This, strangely enough, follows the Swiss and/or Austrian standardization, requiring a different cable. In any case, of course, the standardized cord I bought at Media Markt did not work.</p>

<p>It takes about an hour to get from our apartment to this Media Markt, and I was now on day 37 without internet in the apartment. We needed to order the right cord off of amazon. There are two places in our tiny ex-DDR town that have free wifi- the train station and the holiday inn. The holiday inn is about 2 minutes from our house, so I went there, only to find that their internet wasn’t working, so I had to go to the train station, which is 15 minutes in the opposite direction from our front door. Augh. So I did my best little “Run Lola Run” over to the train station, sent Kaden the link to the correct cord just as my phone died, and then I walked over to a gas station and bought us two Bumbum popsicles because they are delicious and it had already been a Bumbum of a day.</p>

<p>At least on the way home checked the mail and found that we now had a laundry card. What on earth is a laundry card? Well, it took me two weeks to figure out that Ze System for our laundry room was that you needed a specific, pre-loaded card from Maintenance, which you could use to start your washer. For the past month, I had been doing laundry in the bathtub, wringing it out by hand, and hanging it to dry in our loft, because it is against our housing ordinances to have it on the balcony. This sounds very idyllic in a West-Side-Story, Marvellous-Mrs-Maisel way, but it really just means sitting in an apartment without AC over a sweltering bathtub of socks that smell worse than anything you have ever seen in a laundry bin before because the two of you have been walking everywhere in the middle of summer and your socks are about to gain sentience. In order to get this card, we had to go to an ATM, get cash, find an envelope, write our return address on it, and drop it in the Maintenance mailbox, praying to the prussian gods that you had done all of that right. I washed 3 different loads yesterday, and let me tell you, my socks smell better than ever. I am thrilled.</p>

<p>I washed them, but did not dry them, because someone had set their laundry on an <em>eight-hour dry cycle.</em> Honestly that’s probably what you need to get clothes actually dry, but the rest the building just hangs the slightly damp clothes in the washroom! Also, I have yet to understand the washer display, which told me my laundry would take 25 minutes. 26 minutes later, I was sitting in the laundry room staring at a washer that said 18 minutes left. Einstein was probably inspired by German washing maschines to create his theory of relativity.</p>

<p>After I was done laundering, a neighbor came by to scold me for shutting the door too loudly, before returning home to scream at his wife for the way she washed his speedos. I can’t make this stuff up if I tried.</p>

<p>At that point, I had done no cooking, the house was a mess, and I was supposed to be meeting Kaden at the church building, so he could practice the organ for the solo he was doing this week. I grabbed some bread 
and cheese for us, hopped on the bus, and like the adult I am, proceeded to cry while listening to Taylor swift, then called my mom to complain about how tired I was of Ze @!#$ing System. She and Kaden were both very kind, very sympathetic, and very amused by the insanity of it all. We got home well after dark (impressive when the sun sets at 10:30 pm) and ate our Bumbums while watching New Girl, the only show we have downloaded on Kaden’s laptop, both of which hit the spot.</p>

<p>But today, I looked at the mountain of dished I need to wash by hand and the laundry I now needed to fold and decided that I wasn’t going to spend my day doing that and instead, I rode the train to a beautiful
city park, where I am currently sitting on a lounge-chair in the “laying lawn” and listening to birds sing and a daycare group play games. It’s glorious weather, once I get hungry I’m going to go over to the little stand by the pond and get a fabulous currywurst, or go to the bee house and see the honey they’re making, or go hike to the top of the hill here in the park, which is covered in the most beautiful wildflowers. For areas and days like this, I guess I can put up with Ze System.</p>
